## Online Synthesizer with Web Audio API & Spring Framework

### Overview
Web synthesizer, harnessing the power of the Web Audio API for real-time audio synthesis, tightly integrated with the Spring Framework for a seamless backend experience.

The original idea was to utilize Pure Data for audio capabilities, but after thoughtful consideration and exploration, we've shifted our approach to the Web Audio API. This transition enables a more direct and streamlined integration with web technologies while maintaining robust backend support with Spring.
