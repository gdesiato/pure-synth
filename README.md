## Web API for Audio Synthesis

### Overview
Online synthesizer, harnessing the power of Java Sound API for audio synthesis, tightly integrated with the Spring Framework for a seamless backend experience.

The original idea was to utilize Pure Data for audio capabilities, but after thoughtful consideration and exploration of other possibilities like Web Audio API, the direction taken implied the use of Java Sound API. This transition enables a more direct and streamlined integration with web technologies while maintaining robust backend support with Spring.
